# Return Ready Lab 09

* Part A - Foundations 3.4
* Part B - Foundations 3.5
* Part C - Instructor Challenge

## Part A

### Example and Activity 01

#### Step 01

In the package `lab15.part_a.examples` look at the file `Example01_LossOfDecimal` and write comments for each line of code. When complete review with instructor.

#### Step 02

In the package `labs.lab15.part_a.activity` complete the `Activity01_Populations` by following the steps outlined within Populations Class

Your program is working correctly, if when run, the following is the output:

```
Current World Population: 7000000000
World population in 1950: 221000000140200000054700000033900000013000000
Current Asia Population: 4200000000
```

### Example and Activity 02

#### Step 01

In the package `lab15.part_a.examples` look at the file `Example02_Parsing` and write comments for each line of code. When complete review with instructor.

#### Step 02

In the package `labs.lab15.part_a.activity` complete the `Activity02_Parsing` per the following:

        Create a variable of datatype String and assign it a numeric value
        Print out the message that is expected per the example below
        Create a variable to parse the String into the appropriate data type
        Print out the message that is expected per the example below

Your program is working correctly, if when run, the following is the output:

```
The string value is: 37.5
The integer value is: 37.5
```

### Example and Activity 03

#### Step 01

In the package `lab15.part_a.examples` look at the file `Example03_TypeCasting` and write comments for each line of code. When complete review with instructor.

#### Step 02

In the package `labs.lab15.part_a.activity` complete the `Activity03_TypeCasting` per the following:

        Declare and initialize a byte with a value of 128
        Declare and initialize a short with a value of 128
        Create a print statement that casts this short to a byte
        Declare and initialize a byte with a value of 127
        Add 1 to this variable and print it
        Add 1 to this variable again and print it again
        *** PLEASE NOTE *** The steps will give you an error, 
        the point of the lab is for you to properly cast to make this run corretly. ***

Your program is working correctly, if when run, the following is the output:

```
The value of the short variable is: -128
The value of the byte variable is: -127
```

## Part B

### Example and Activity 01

#### Step 01

In the package `lab15.part_b.examples` look at the file `Example01_Scanner` and write comments for each line of code. When complete review with instructor.

#### Step 02

In the package `labs.lab15.part_b.activity` complete the `Activity01_Scanner` per the following:

    Create a Scanner - name it anything other than scanner
    Ask the user to pass in a number but store it as a String
    Store the user input appropriately and print it out
    Parse the input as an integer
    Print its value +1

Your program is working correctly, if when run, the following is the output:
```
Please enter a number: 
27
Your number increased by one is: 28
```
