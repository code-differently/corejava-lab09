* Part B - Foundations 3.5
* Part C - Instructor Challenge

## Part A

### Example and Activity 01

#### Step 01

In the package `lab15.part_a.examples` look at the file `Example01_LossOfDecimal` and write comments for each line of code. When complete review with instructor.

#### Step 02

In the package `labs.lab15.part_a.activity` complete the `Activity01` by following the steps outlined inside of the file

Your program is working correctly, if when run, the following is the output:

```
Current World Population: 7000000000
World population in 1950: 221000000140200000054700000033900000013000000
Current Asia Population: 4200000000
```

### Example and Activity 02

#### Step 01

In the package `lab15.part_a.examples` look at the file `Example02_ResultWithDecimal` and write comments for each line of code. When complete review with instructor.

#### Step 02

In the package `labs.lab15.part_a.activity` complete the `Activity03_TypeCasting` by following the steps:

        Declare and initialize a byte with a value of 128
        Declare and initialize a short with a value of 128
        Create a print statement that casts this short to a byte
        Declare and initialize a byte with a value of 127
        Add 1 to this variable and print it
        Add 1 to this variable again and print it again
        *** PLEASE NOTE *** The steps will give you an error, 
        the point of the lab is for you to properly cast to make this run corretly. ***

Your program is working correctly, if when run, the following is the output:

```
The value of the short variable is: -128
The value of the byte variable is: -127
```
